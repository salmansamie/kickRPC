# kickRPC

Use this script to run a local script remotely without creating any file on the remote host.

Using ssh via fabric -> paramiko library. If you see cryptography lib error, use the previous
version: cryptography==2.4.2

Here, `kicker.py` runs locally and is the RPC executor and `remote.sh` runs on the server.





Free to use. Hope it helps.

Welcome any improvements/suggestions.
